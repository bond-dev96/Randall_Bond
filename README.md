:smiling_face_with_open_hands: Little bit about me, I'm 28 years old I have a fiance of 14 years. 
We have been through everything together, we have two kiddos one 
boy who is 9, and a girl who is 7. And one of those people who 
didn't decide to get their stuff together later in life. But 
I always knew that one day I would want to go into this industry. 
I was never big into tech slash hardware until the first Android 
phones came out. And I fell in love with him, the user interface 
the ability to unlock boot loaders or gain root access to the phone 
has always intrigued me. But ive always just kind of fooled around 
with it as a hobby until February of 2022 when I took a leap of faith 
and decided to apply for my FAFSA and go to school and I knew exactly 
what I wanted to go for (Mobile Software Development) It's funny I always 
remembered growing up seeing the commercials for Devry University and back 
then they more advertised it for like the gaming industry I guess to make 
it more appealing to people. (Even though that's not what made me want to go) 
And that's what I thought of was that school, so I put it as my main school when 
applying for my FAFSA And my secondary was my local community college 
(YIKES (Glad I didn't go there)) I even hit a roadblock along the way when 
trying to get in because apparently I was a victim of identity theft and 
didn't even know it I had an outstanding bill at a college in California 
and I've never even been outside my state of Kentucky besides once or twice ha ha. 
But after months of correlating with the head of finances at that school the fees 
got waived and I got to start attending school and it's been obliged ever since then. 
The best program I could get in was for software development and design, I have kept 
my grade point average at least above a 3.81 gpa (Never dropped lower than that) And 
for most of the time stayed above 3.85. In a long journey that will come to a halt in 
January of 2025 when I achieve my undergraduate certificate for software development 
and design. I am currently in one of my favorite classes right now, it is mobile software 
development (Should say Android development because that's all we work with thank goodness) 
But along my journey I have attended classes specifically dedicated to programming languages 
like python, C#, C, C+, C++, Java, And that's just to name a few. Before I get off here I'll 
stay a few of my hobbies or things I like to do for fun (Other than geek on Android phones ha ha) 
I love spending time with my family, Me and my fiance and kids loved to game together (Mostly fortnight, 
and a little bit of Dragon Ball and sparking zero here lately) And I'm a huge fan of rap music or hip hop 
my favorite artists are in the Strange Music label Ran by rap artist Tech N9ne Otherwise known as Aaron Yates. 
Some of my other favorite artists inside the label are King ISO, X-Raided, Joey cool, outside of their label I 
like Chris Webby and Ekoh. I hope I didn't overbear anyone with that information but that's as much as I can really 
give you about me, everyone thrive and stay blessed, peace. :saluting_face:
